    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza crust made out of cheese results in a delicious, crispy crust. As far as the toppings go, add as many or as little as you want. What's best of all, it's keto!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup almond flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten, at room temperature</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 ounces Mexican chorizo, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>¼ cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir well. Add almond flour, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and black pepper. Use your hands to combine dough. Once combined, add beaten egg and stir until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Spray 2 large pieces of parchment paper with non-stick spray. Place dough on one piece of parchment paper and cover with the second piece. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten pizza dough to a 10-inch round. Remove top parchment paper and place bottom piece of parchment paper with flattened pizza dough onto a baking sheet. Pierce all of the pizza dough with a fork to prevent the dough from rising.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottom starts to brown, 12 to 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile place chorizo in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a paper towel. Microwave in three 1-minute increments, uncovering and stirring meat well after each.</li>
        <li>Remove pizza crust from oven and top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, chorizo, salsa, and onion. Bake until cheese is melted, 4 to 6 minutes more. Garnish with cilantro leaves.</li>
    </ol>
